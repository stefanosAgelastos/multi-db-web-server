# Diagrams

Here we store relevant Diagrams that visualize parts of our systems or design goals and proposals.

You can edit the diagrams by clicking on the link, but keep in mind that the editor will open the version that is on the `documentation` branch. Any changes you make will be saved on that branch. Feel free to make changes and make a PR to `main` whenever you have a "Done" version.
